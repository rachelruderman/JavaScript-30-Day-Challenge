    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    console.log(age, age2)
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2)
    //so the value of strings, numbers and booleans are stored, and if you change one, it's ok; it's not going to change the other

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(players, team)
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //when you update any of the arrays, it's always going to go back to the reference where it was; you need to make a copy of the array and update that, as so
    // now here is the problem!
    //they're pointing to the same reference
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    //if you pass slice nothing, it will make a copy of the array

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    //create a new array and spread the old array into the new array

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    //Array.from and spread are Wes' favorite ways
    //The Array.from() method creates a new Array instance from an array-like or iterable object.

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    
    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
