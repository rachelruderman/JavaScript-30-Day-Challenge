    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    console.log(age, age2)
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2)
    //so the value of strings, numbers and booleans are stored, and if you change one, it's ok; it's not going to change the other

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(players, team)
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //when you update any of the arrays, it's always going to go back to the reference where it was; you need to make a copy of the array and update that, as so
    // now here is the problem!
    //they're pointing to the same reference
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    //if you pass slice nothing, it will make a copy of the array

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    //create a new array and spread the old array into the new array

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    //Array.from and spread are Wes' favorite ways
    //The Array.from() method creates a new Array instance from an array-like or iterable object.

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person
    // captain.number = 99

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // start with a blank object, pass it the object you wish to copy all the properties from, then you sort of fold in your new properties that you wish to overwrite, and stick it into its own variable
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12})
    console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.log(wes)

    //if i wanted to make a copy
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'
    //now wes.social.twitter is the same. When you use Object.assign, it only copies one level deep; the rest is reference. Could use clone deep, however very rarely do you need to clone an object that deep, might want to go another route

    //sneaky getaround to shake all the references. often referred to as "the poor man's deep clone"
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
